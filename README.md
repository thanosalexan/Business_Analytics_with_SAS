# Business_Analytics_with_SAS

In this  assignment, I used SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning on SAS Viya to analyze data for three case studies: market basket analysis (association rules), customer segmentation (clustering), and churn prediction. The deliverable is a report tailored for both technical and business audiences, with writing styles adjusted accordingly.

Each case study begins with an executive summary for management, highlighting the problem, the approach used, methods and tools applied, and the final result, all in a concise and clear manner.
